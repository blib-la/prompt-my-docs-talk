## Title
[Prompt my Docs](https://github.com/failfa-st/prompt-my-docs) - ChatGPT for your own data


## Description

Ever wished for a ChatGPT-like interaction tailored to your data? Join us as we explore the realm of [retrieval-augmented AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00083) through [hyv](https://github.com/failfa-st/hyv). We'll walk you through the steps â€” from preparing documents for the vector database [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), to crafting an AI agent that thinks like a JavaScript developer, leveraging [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to extract insights directly from our curated data. Dive deep with us into the art of creating truly personalized AI experiences.
